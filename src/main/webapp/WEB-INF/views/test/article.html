                <div class='title'>Cafés</div>
                <div>At present, Prague experiences a slow but steady enlightement as for coffee culture is concerned. It means that in case you are coffee enthusiasts, you are in for a treat here.</div>
                <div>First, we have - as anywhere else in the world - international coffeehouse chains. After a few years of a fierce competition at the very beginning of this millenium, when five or six huge coffee companies tried to succeed in the Czech Republic, today only two of them can declare themselves as winners: <a class='external' href='http://www.starbuckscoffee.cz/'>Starbucks</a> (a bit more expensive) and <a class='external' href='http://www.costa-coffee.cz/'>Costa Coffee</a>. These are for people who like their coffee american-style: big mugs, lot of milk, syrup included. But if you really want to enjoy a fresh taste of a carefully and freshly roasted coffee, you have to head to other places.</div>
                <div>Definitely NOT to any of <a href='http://www.crosscafe.cz/' class='external'>Crosscafe</a> shops! This Czech network of “modern” coffeeshops, trying to copy a fancy style of bigger coffehouses and combine it with local commodities, serves under the name of “cappuccino” a machine-made distasteful mixture resembling dirty bath foam. If you see one of their shops and are tempted to have a cup, think again and then better cross the street to the opposite side of the road - it is for your own good.</div>
                <div>But let’s get back to the good cafés we have here. There are two main types of them in Prague: The firsts are cozy coffeeshops in which you’d love to spend a whole afternoon, sunk in some huge cushiony armchair and reading a good old book. The others are small places with only a few not very comfortable seats, where you’d prefer only to grab a coffee-to-go or stay just for a couple of minutes to check your e-mails and finish your espresso. But all these cafés have one thing in common: they know how to make a good coffee.</div>
                <div>If I’d have to choose the most comfortable of them all, despite all the effort for a definitive decision still two names come to mind. <a href='cafeLounge' class='profileLoader'>Café Lounge</a>, conveniently situated right under the Petřín hill, is a text-book example of a professional coffee making business. It is repeatedly awarded The Best Café of the Year prize, the staff is both friendly and skillful and the back-garden right next to the historical Hunger Wall is just a place to enjoy a long summer evening. In spite of its large rooms it is quite often full to the top, so reservation is recommended. <a href='alCafetero' class='profileLoader'>Al Cafetero</a>, on the other hand, is a typical family run coffeeshop. Mr. Gregora, the owner, most usually waits on the tables by himself, because he is afraid to entrust such a delicate process as coffee brewing to someone else, and he knows some of the regulars personally. Try to get a place on one of the small couches and test some alternative (means “non Italian”) ways of coffee preparation. Once you sit down, both of these places are very hard to leave - take my word for that.</div>
                <div>There are some other coffeeshops in Prague which are - reportedly - addictive to some people, but I did not fall for these places and usually only drink my coffee and go. Well, you can try by yourselves and see, whether you’ll tend to linger longer or not. <a href='mujSalekKavy' class='profileLoader'>Můj šálek kávy</a> (“My cup of coffee”) is situated a bit far from the city center in Karlín and its best asset is freshly roasted coffee from a Doubleshot roasting company. <a href='prazirna' class='profileLoader'>Pražírna</a> (“Roaster”) on the contrary lies just next to one of the busiest transport hub of Prague: I.P.Pavlova. In the interior you can admire a genuine coffee bean roaster (who’d guess, right?) and if you are lucky, your cappuccino will be prepared by Mr. Smrčka, a Czech Barista of the Year 2011.</div>
                <div>As for the places that are less cushion-type and more get-me-a-coffee-and-I’ll-go-type, there is quite a few of them in Prague and new ones are still opening. <a href='iNeedCoffee' class='profileLoader'>I Need Coffee</a> is probably the closest to the city center - a very simple offers quite a good coffee brew and some cookies worth trying. Another one, <a href='meziZrnky' class='profileLoader'>Mezi zrnky</a> (“Among beans”), is also fairly near. A few months ago, this café took over an area where it’s predecessor had to close because lack of profitability. Be appreciative to this brave decision and give them a try - not only their coffee is good, also home made cakes are really tasty. <a href='monolok' class='profileLoader'>Monolok</a>, a brand new place, is a bit farther from the most travelled routes , but worth a try in peak time - it has lots of seats and is rarely full. <a href='dumKavy' class='profileLoader'>Dům kávy</a> (“Coffee house”) is more of a shop than a café, with only two tables and about four chairs altogehter, but their espresso or cappuccino is just great.</div>
                <div>And now some tips for adventurers: In one of the biggest market halls in Prague, Pražská tržnice, there is a well hidden coffee shop named <a href='alzacafe' class='profileLoader'>Alza Café</a>. Run by Doubleshot roasting company (the same as <a href='mujSalekKavy' class='profileLoader'>Můj šálek kávy</a>), this place offers top espresso-based beverages, and their muffins and especially cookies are also worth a try. And if you do not insist on sitting down for a while and a plastic cup in your hand is enough for your coffee-loving taste buds, visit a market stall in an open-air Jiřák market. A stall marked “Kávový klub” is staffed by Adam Dvořák, barista’s trainer and lecturer. Do not hesitate to have a chat about your coffee experiences and enjoy your hot beverage while strolling along the market. My guess is that coffee won’t be your only purchase.</div>
